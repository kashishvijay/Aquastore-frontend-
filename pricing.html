        <h3>Mickey Mouse Platy - 50$</h3>
        <p>
            Platys are colorful, live-bearing fish that are very suitable for
            beginners. Since they are live-bearing fish, many hobbyists start out
            with only one fishâ€”which can quickly multiply into many fish. The Mickey
            Mouse Platy is named for a very specific color pattern formed in the
            tail peduncle.

        <h3>Guppies - 70$</h3>
        <p>
            Guppies are a cornerstone of the small fish aquarium hobby. Another
            live-breeding species, guppy tanks are often overrun with offspring from
            frequent breeding. The best skill any guppy owner can learn is to tell
            the difference between males and females to keep populations from
            exploding.

        <h3>Zebra danio (Zebrafish) - 90$</h3>
        <p>
            These small, striped fish are one of the few in the aquarium hobby that
            don't require tropical temperatures. Zebrafish are peaceful, community
            players that love schooling in groups. There are multiple Danio species
            available in the pet market with a variety of colors and markings.

        <h3>Neon Tetra - 60$</h3>
        <p>
            One of the most common small freshwater aquarium species is the Neon
            Tetra. These fish are known for their colorful appearance with bright
            red and blue stripes. They are great community fish and school together
            in a vibrant wave. The Cardinal or Red Neon Tetra is another, very
            similar species. They are distinguishable from the more common Neon
            Tetra by their longer red belly bar. The Black Neon Tetra is a similar
            species with black bars instead of color.

        <h3>White Cloud Mountain Minnow - 70$</h3>
        <p>
            The White Cloud Mountain Minnow is another species of small community
            fish that does not require tropical temperatures. These fish do well in
            temperate tanks with Zebrafish and goldfish, provided they are not snack
            size. These fish are common in some aquascape setups where focus is put
            on the plants, not necessarily the fish.

        red schooling fish with black fins provide color to natural tankscapes.
        These fish are very active, and have the habit of biting fins of their
        friends and tankmates.
